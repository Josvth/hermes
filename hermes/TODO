- Allow color to be specified ad RGB + Alpha
- Make satellite.parent.r_of(satellite) a prettier syntax
- Rotation of the Earth at Epoch
- Let satellites have a state instead of extending an orbit
-- Bonus points for making the state relate to that of the parent
-- Probably best to create a 'DependClassicalState' that has pointers to the parent
- Specify time step by a TimeDelta
- Move time instances from Scenario to Simulation ::grin::
- Implement a better tree data structure (i.e. Anytree or Treelib)
- Implement nice naming in analysis contact opportunities
- Have the SatGroups take an .rr pointer to the positions in the top node (like in the analysis)
